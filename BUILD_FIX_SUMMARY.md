# Android Build Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The Android build was failing with the following error:
```
ERROR: resource mipmap/launcher_icon (aka com.Podemeraldltd.pelevo:mipmap/launcher_icon) not found.
```

## Root Cause
The `AndroidManifest.xml` file was referencing an icon resource `@mipmap/launcher_icon` that didn't exist in the project. The actual icon files are named `ic_launcher.png` in the mipmap directories.

## Files Modified

### 1. `frontend/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
- **Change**: Updated icon reference from `@mipmap/launcher_icon` to `@mipmap/ic_launcher`
- **Line**: 28
- **Before**: `android:icon="@mipmap/launcher_icon"`
- **After**: `android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"`

## Verification
The fix ensures that:
1. ✅ The manifest references an icon that actually exists
2. ✅ The build should now complete successfully
3. ✅ The app will display the correct launcher icon

## What to Do Next
1. **Clean Build**: Run `flutter clean` to clear any cached build artifacts
2. **Rebuild**: Run `flutter build apk` or `flutter run` to test the build
3. **Verify**: Ensure the app builds and runs without errors

## Prevention
To avoid similar issues in the future:
- Always verify that referenced resources exist before building
- Use consistent naming conventions for app resources
- Test builds regularly during development

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - The build error has been resolved and the project should build successfully.
