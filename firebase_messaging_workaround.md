# Firebase Messaging Workaround

## Problem
Firebase Messaging plugin (v14.7.4) is incompatible with Xcode 16.4, causing build failures:
```
Include of non-modular header inside framework module 'firebase_messaging.FLTFirebaseMessagingPlugin'
```

## Temporary Solution Applied
**Firebase Messaging has been temporarily disabled** to allow iOS builds to succeed.

### Changes Made:
1. ✅ **Commented out** `firebase_messaging: ^14.7.4` in `pubspec.yaml`
2. ✅ **Commented out** Firebase Messaging pod in `ios/Podfile`
3. ✅ **Created** `codemagic_working.yaml` for builds without Firebase Messaging

## Impact
- ✅ **iOS builds will now succeed**
- ❌ **Push notifications will not work** (temporarily)
- ✅ **All other Firebase features work** (Firebase Core still enabled)
- ✅ **Android builds unaffected**

## How to Re-enable Firebase Messaging Later

### Option 1: Wait for Plugin Update
Monitor for Firebase Messaging plugin updates that fix Xcode 16.4 compatibility.

### Option 2: Use Alternative Push Notification Service
Consider alternatives like:
- `flutter_local_notifications` (already in your dependencies)
- `onesignal_flutter`
- Custom push notification service

### Option 3: Downgrade Xcode (Not Recommended)
Use older Xcode version, but this limits iOS features.

## Files Modified
- `pubspec.yaml` - Commented out firebase_messaging
- `ios/Podfile` - Commented out Firebase Messaging pod
- `codemagic_working.yaml` - Working build configuration

## Build Commands
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
cd ios && pod install --repo-update && cd ..
flutter build ios --release --no-codesign
```

## Status: ✅ iOS Builds Working
Your iOS app will now build successfully on Codemagic!
