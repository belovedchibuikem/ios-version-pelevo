## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. **Add Dependencies**

```yaml
dependencies:
  just_audio: ^0.9.36
  audio_session: ^0.1.18
  wakelock_plus: ^1.1.4
  provider: any
  shared_preferences: ^2.2.2
```

### 2. **Setup Provider**

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(
    MultiProvider(
      providers: [
        ChangeNotifierProvider(create: (_) => PodcastPlayerProvider()),
      ],
      child: const MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}
```

### 3. **Add Player to App**

```dart
class MainScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Stack(
        children: [
          // Your main content
          YourMainContent(),
          
          // Podcast Player (floating at bottom)
          const Positioned(
            bottom: 0,
            left: 0,
            right: 0,
            child: PodcastPlayer(),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## üì± Usage Examples

### Play an Episode

```dart
final playerProvider = Provider.of<PodcastPlayerProvider>(context, listen: false);

// Set episode and start playing
playerProvider.setCurrentEpisode(episode);
playerProvider.play();

// Show full player
playerProvider.setMinimized(false);
```

### Show Episode Detail Modal

```dart
showModalBottomSheet(
  context: context,
  isScrollControlled: true,
  backgroundColor: Colors.transparent,
  builder: (context) => DraggableScrollableSheet(
    initialChildSize: 0.9,
    minChildSize: 0.5,
    maxChildSize: 0.95,
    builder: (context, scrollController) => EpisodeDetailModal(
      episode: episode,
      episodes: episodeList,
      episodeIndex: index,
    ),
  ),
);
```

### Control Playback

```dart
final audioService = AudioPlayerService();

// Play/Pause
if (playerProvider.isPlaying) {
  audioService.pause();
} else {
  audioService.play();
}

// Seek to position
audioService.seekTo(Duration(minutes: 5, seconds: 30));

// Set playback speed
audioService.setPlaybackSpeed(1.5);
```

## üé® Theme Integration

The player system uses the app's main theme colors:

- **Primary**: Main buttons and active elements
- **Surface**: Background colors
- **OnSurface**: Text colors
- **Outline**: Borders and dividers
- **Error**: Delete actions

## üîß Configuration

### Audio Session Settings

```dart
await _audioSession!.configure(const AudioSessionConfiguration(
  avAudioSessionCategory: AVAudioSessionCategory.playback,
  avAudioSessionCategoryOptions: AVAudioSessionCategoryOptions.allowBluetooth |
      AVAudioSessionCategoryOptions.allowBluetoothA2DP |
      AVAudioSessionCategoryOptions.allowAirPlay |
      AVAudioSessionCategoryOptions.defaultToSpeaker,
  androidAudioAttributes: AndroidAudioAttributes(
    contentType: AndroidAudioContentType.music,
    usage: AndroidAudioUsage.media,
  ),
  androidAudioFocusGainType: AndroidAudioFocusGainType.gain,
  androidWillPauseWhenDucked: true,
));
```

### Player Settings

```dart
// Auto-play next episode
playerProvider.toggleAutoPlayNext();

// Keep screen on during playback
playerProvider.toggleKeepScreenOn();

// Set sleep timer
playerProvider.setSleepTimer(Duration(minutes: 30));
```

## üìä State Persistence

The player automatically saves and restores:
- Current episode and queue
- Playback position and duration
- Player settings (shuffle, repeat, speed)
- UI state (minimized/maximized)
- Sleep timer settings

## üîÑ Integration Points

### Episode List Integration

```dart
// In your episode list item
EpisodeListItem(
  episode: episode,
  isCurrentlyPlaying: playerProvider.currentEpisode?.id == episode.id,
  playProgress: playerProvider.progressPercentage,
  onTap: () {
    // Show episode detail modal
    _showEpisodeDetailModal(context, episode);
  },
  onLongPress: () {
    // Enter selection mode
    _enterSelectionMode();
  },
)
```

### Navigation Integration

```dart
// The player automatically appears on all screens
// No need to manually add it to each screen

// Just ensure the PodcastPlayer widget is in your main app structure
```

## üß™ Testing

### Demo Mode

Use the included demo to test the player:

```dart
// Run the demo app
flutter run -t lib/main_with_player.dart
